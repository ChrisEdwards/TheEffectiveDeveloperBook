# Chapter 1: What makes a great developer?

So what makes a developer great? I have realized several attributes that are common to truly great developers.

- Passion 
- Continuous Learning
- Humility
- Communication Skills

## Passion
Passion is a developer's strongest asset. There are many other positive attributes you can have as a developer, but passion enhances them all. Its gushes forth motivation to improve all the other attributes. Of all the attributes, none of them have can have such a profound affect on your career as passion.

Let's look at an example to show you what I mean.

Meet John. John is good at programming. He comes in to work at 8 and leaves at 5. He writes quality code and gets the job done. He spends lots of time with his family, and enjoys reading fiction and playing computer games in his free time. He got to level 80 in three weeks in World of Warcraft.

Now meet Bob. Bob also works 8-5. On his commute to and from work he listens to a podcast on Agile development practices. He usually spends his lunch hour reading a few blogs or checking out a screencast on some new framework. On Wednesdays he attends a lunch-n-learn with some other developers to discuss the unit testing book they are reading together. When he gets home, he eats supper with his family and spends some time with them before putting his kids to bed. He spends some time with his wife, then reads some more in the unit testing book or codes some new features for an open source project he's been contributing to. 

Who do you think is going to be more effective in their job? Who would you want on your team? Who would you hire? Without even describing Bob's code quality or work ethic, did you assume that he is the better developer? Why?

### Benefits of passion
Passion drives so many positive behaviors. People with passion perform better without even thinking about it. The benefits of passion are great..and contribute to making the person great. 

The developer with passion has a great advantage over other developers because he enjoys what he does. When something becomes fun, it ceases to be work. He will put in the extra hours to learn something without thinking about it, but it's not work. It's fun. Rather than playing computer games, he will further his career. You see, the passionate developer's hobby is his job.

Passion also provides a great advantage in times of difficulty. When the going gets hard, passion provides the motivation to hang in there and tough it out. It stops you from giving up on becoming great.

### What is passion?
So you want to be like Bob. You want that kind of driving passion? First let's look at what passion is. It's pretty simple really. Its a desire to do something. It's a burning desire to do it. (does this even belong)

Do I have to be born with passion?
You are probably wondering, "Do I have to be born with passion? Or can I cultivate it?" I think the answer is obvious. No one is born passionate about something. They acquire that passion somewhere along the way. It wasn't until I was 12 or so that I began to have a passion for computers (and later, software development). Prior to that, I didn't know anything about computers, so how could I be passionate about it?

### How do I cultivate passion?
So we see that we aren't born with passion, so how to you get it? How do you cultivate it? Let's begin with a story.

When Billy was little, he took guitar lessons. He liked the guitar, but when he played it, it didn't sound to good. It was a lot of work, and he quickly got bored of it and gave up. Later in life, he had a friend that played very well, so Billy decided to try again (with a little encouragement from his friend). The first few weeks weren't so fun. However, after learning how to play his favorite song, (song?), he found it was much more fun. Anytime he got discouraged and had a hard time playing something, he would just break out singing the chorus (to his dog's dismay) as he played the song again. This got him though the more difficult lessons and Billy became a very accomplished guitar player.

So, did you notice the turning point in Billy's guitar career? Everything changed when he started to enjoy playing it. It's hard to enjoy foul notes and poor rhythm. But once you acquire some skills and get a little better, your enjoyment increases. When that happens, it drives you to practice and learn more. The effect is cyclical and builds upon itself. This is how passion works. It's a self-feeding (something).

Knowing this, I think we can now look at some logical ways to cultivate passion.

#### Things to do 
*Find something fun.* Because enjoyment is a key part of passion, you need to find some aspect of software development that you really enjoy. Do you like working on the UI? How about writing tests? Try to spend some time on the things you enjoy. If you can't find time to do those things on the job, try them at home or over your lunch hour. Put some joy in your job.

*Experiment* Try some different ways of doing things you already do. Finding a better way to do something gives you a boost of excitement and also helps expand your understanding of whatever you are doing. 

*Learn something new.* Learn a new framework, or new language. This helps get you interested and engages your thinking. It may change the way you think about existing problems you have to solve at work. Learning breeds excitementâ€¦which feeds passion in a huge way.

*Change projects/job* Probably the first thing you need to ask is "Am I happy here?" or "Do I even like software development". While passion doesn't require you to love it to start, if you don't even like it a little bit, you will be hard pressed to gain the kind of passion I am talking about. Perhaps you need to change careers. Think about where you work now. Do you like the company? Do you have opportunities to work on something "fun"? If not, maybe you need to find a new place to work. 

*Deliberate Practice*
This topic could fill a chapter in itself, but I present it here because it helps feed passion. If you practice your craft, you will get better. Getting better feeds your confidence which feeds your enjoyment which feeds your passion which feeds your desire to practice more. You get the picture.

The bottom line is what my dad always used to tell me (though I was tired of hearing it), "Practice makes perfect." Well, we may not be seeking perfection, we do want to get better. Practice makes you better. If you want to be effective, you have to constantly improve.

Deliberate Practice refers to your ability to intentionally practice with the goal of getting better. Practice those things that are impeding you from being more effective. There are many tools to help you. There are Code Katas available that have you solve a problem in code, as a practice exercise. You can find some at (urls).

*Know/Avoid Draining Weaknesses*
Know what drains you
Minimize time on actions that drain you.
Difference between weakness you need to work on and weakness that drains you.
Examples:
- Difficult Co-workers
- Mundane Tasks (automate)
- Working in an area you aren't excited about (UI vs. Business Logic)

*Be Enthusiastic*
Let your passion be seen by others. Its infectious. You may influence others to be as excited as yourself. 

*Try to be around other enthusiastic people*
Try to be around other enthusiastic people, because it will help you be more excited. Passion feeds passion. A roomful of passionate people is a sight to behold. Here are some ideas of ways to surround yourself with other passionate people.
- Attend user groups or conferences
- Read blogs
- Follow passionate people on twitter.

*Seek role models*
Look for someone who can serve as a role model. Someone who has achieved what you seek to achieve and learn from them. Someone you can look up to. How did they get where they are? Can you follow in their footsteps. 


    Find others to encourage/praise you
    Being around these kind of people motivate you
    The opposite kind of people will drain you.
Be obsessed?

*Focus on strengths*
I used to always think I had to focus on the areas I am weakest in. And I do feel this is appropriate in some areas, but one thing that feeds passion is working in an area of strength. If you feel confident, you are more likely to feel fulfilled. Try to work on things that fulfill you. Try to work in an area of strength. 

If you are unsure where your strengths lie, here are some questions that may lead you to it.
- What fulfills you?
- What to others tend to compliment you on?
- What are you feel most confident doing?

The areas I am talking about here (for focus) are smaller subareas of your career focus. For instance UI vs. backend code, Security vs. application code, etc. All of these areas may fall under the role of a software developer, but there is leeway in that title that allows you to focus on many different areas. Some will feed your passion. Some will drain it. Sometimes you will have a choice. When you do, choose wisely.

As a side note, be aware that working in an area of weakness is necessary to grow into a fully effective developer. You need to constantly be learning new things. The areas of weakness I am referring to here are areas that drain your passion, not areas of ignorance. Be deliberate about eliminating ignorance by learning. Expand...
    What fulfills you
    What to people compliment you on?
    Not necessarily what you are already good at.

#### Things to avoid
Just as there are things that feed your passion, there are some that drain it. Be aware of these things and avoid them when possible. Here is a possible list:

*Working in an area of weakness*
You need to feel confident to spark your passion. At the least, you need to feel as if you are growing in the area you are working in. However, some areas are just plain weaknesses that you are uncomfortable and unhappy working in. For instance, if I were placed in a sales position where I had to talk to people day in and day out to make sales, I would fail. I may learn to get betterâ€¦but why would I want to do that? Its an area of weakness that I have no intention of improving in. It saps my passion.

Don't confuse what I am saying here. There are weaknesses  you will have that you want to work on. And working on them will take you out of your comfort zone. This is called learning and growing. It's good for you. This is not a weakness to avoid. The kind of weaknesses I am referring to here are those that really pull you down and you have decided not to work on. Like taking tech support calls, or writing pure database code. If you really don't want to do these things because you dread going to work every day when you know you have to do themâ€¦its time for a change.

*Difficult relationships at work*
This could be a coworker or your boss. One difficult personality can bring down a whole team. Seek to change teams or managers if you need to. Worst case scenario, its time to get your resume ready.

*Too much pressure/ stress* We all find ourselves in this situation at one time or another in our career. Under stress, you don't have time to do anything but work. There is no learning, and you aren't given time to do a a good job you can feel good about. Hence, your passion will suffer. 

If you find yourself in this scenario, try to step back and objectively analyze the situation. Is it temporary? If so, just hang in there and keep positive. If it's a persistent problem then determine if there's something you can do to change the organization. Talk with your manager/team lead about it. As a last resortâ€¦yepâ€¦you guessed itâ€¦resume time.

*Working on something you don't enjoy* So you hate working on UI code, and wouldn't you know it? That's what you are stuck doing day in and day out. I have come across many people in the same situation. I have met many of them in interviewsâ€¦as they were looking for a way out. Do what you can to get reassigned. Realize that sometimes you have to work on stuff you don't likeâ€¦just don't let it become your permanent job description.

*Lack of control over your work* We need freedom to express ourselves in code. Sometimes we have oppressive co-workers or managers that tightly control every aspect of our job that we feel more like slaves than employees. Flee this. Some control is ok, but if it stifles your ability to work, seek a remedy.
    What you work on
    How you work
    When you work
    How long you work

*Boredom* Sometimes, you just aren't challenged. Perhaps you have solved all the problems so well and automated everything so perfectly that the project practically runs itself. What was once exciting is now so simple its boring. Time to move on.

*Negativity/Discouragement* You really need to be around people that encourage you and push you to be better. If you are in a negative environment, or around negative co-workers, it will affect you. Do all you can to get away from these kind of projects/people.

Warning: Passion can lead to imbalance

----
> _The effective developer is passionate about his work. He loves what he does and is therefore driven to do it well._

If you really want to be great at something, you have to love doing it. How can you be motivated to excel at something you don't enjoy? A healthy passion for your work provides a wellspring of motivation. It drives you to do your best, and constantly improve your best. Just think of the advantage this gives you.

You see, we tend to do the things we enjoy. We think about them, read about them, and practice them--because we like them; we call them hobbies. A passionate developer's hobby is his job. Because he loves it, he is driven to do it well. As you can guess, I am passionate about software development. I love reading a good tech book or blog, writing code or writing this book. These activities sharpen my skills, but they don't feel like work. I enjoy them and they come naturally to me. I love what I do and I do what I love. This is the biggest secret to my success.

> **Sidebar: A warning about passion!**
>
> Please be aware that passion can lead to an unbalanced life. Its easy to spend too much time on something you love doing. Resist that temptation. Don't neglect the important areas of your life, like family, friends, church, etc. These are essential for happiness, and they are far more important than work. It's tempting to believe that happiness can come from work alone. However, that kind of happiness is fleeting; it's a lie; burnout and sadness soon take its place.
> 
> I will never forget what a wise friend once told me. He said, "I work to live, I don't live to work". This should be true for all of us.

When I interview developers, one of the most important things I look for is passion. I will hire a passionate developer who is lacking technically. I know their passion more than compensates for their deficiencies. Because passion can have such a profound affect on the ability to learn and grow as a developer, I believe it is one of the strongest assets you can have.
 
## Continuous Learning
>_The effective developer is committed to continuous learning--deliberately acquiring new skills and refining existing ones._

A healthy passion for your work, drives you to continuously learn more and improve your skills. (elaborate)


The software development industry evolves constantly. It's not easy to keep up. Technologies change quickly--what you know today will be obsolete tomorrow.  You must constantly refine your skills and learn new ones or risk being left behind. If you do not enjoy reading, listening to others, and learning from others, you will be at a huge disadvantage to those who do.

So how can you keep up with all the changes and new technologies in this fast changing industry? Here are some ideas:

### Read Books
Reading books is one of the oldest ways to learn, and it is applicable now more than ever. Books are a great way to get a full understanding of a particular area or technology. They are usually structured in such that they cover all aspects of a topic. If you are new to a technology, grabbing a good book on the subject is one of the best ways to get up to speed. Books often make an assumption that the reader has a certain level of knowledge, so the book fills all the gaps that are necessary and tries to present the material in a certain order that will make sense to the reader and build upon concepts progressively. Books are great to establish an initial foundation of knowledge that you can build upon.

#### Select Books Carefully
How do you select which books to read? Time is precious. If you are going to take the time to read a book, make sure it's a good one. Research what others have said about books in the area you are seeking to learn. Find out what books are the "must reads" in that area and pick them up and read them. It is said that the most successful people read and average of ??? books per year (Need citation). 

#### Take Notes or Highlight Your Book
To make the most of reading books, take notes, or highlight the text. Not only does this require you to think a little more (about what to write) but it also involves more motor skills which improves your retention of that information (citation). Furthermore, after reading the book, you can go back and skim your notes to refresh what you may have forgotten. 

#### Read a Book Repeatedly
Don't be afraid to read a book more than once. You will likely get much more out of the book on your second pass through. You see, you usually can't assimilate all the information from a book the first time through. The concepts it presents often depend upon one another. You can't fully understand *Concept C* until you first understand *Concept A* and *Concept B*. Because your first time through a book, you are just learning these concepts for the first time, you may fully understand *Concept A*, but only partially understand *Concept B*. Consequently, you cannot fully understand *Concept C* or any concepts that depend upon it. 

After reading the book the first time, and especially after putting the knowledge you gained into practice, you will have a better understanding of the basic concepts. Then, when you read the book a second time, you will have more experience and knowledge to relate the information to. This will allow you to understand deeper concepts expressed in the book that you may have missed the first time. 

Really good books can be read multiple times and still provide a new depth of information each time. (A great example of this is Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans. I have read this book multiple times and have learned a great deal each time I did.)

As a final note...when you do read a really good book, if you see someone who could benefit from it, please recommend it to them. Be a catalyst to help others learn.

### Read Blogs
While books are great to get a full rounded understanding of a topic, blogs are a good way to continually gain deeper, more specific knowledge of topics. Each blog entry is usually written about a specific, focused subject. Sometimes you may find a series of blog posts that serve as an introduction to some topic...but these are not as common. Following blogs over time will help you to keep up with changes to technologies and keep yourself on the bleeding edge. Unlike books, which take time to write and publish, blog entries can be written very quickly and therefore contain knowledge that may  not have had time to be published. Blogs are the bleeding edge of thought in the software world (and most others as well).

However, because blog entries are so small, focused, and released quickly, they usually assume the reader knows a great deal about the topic, so readers new to the technology may not know enough for the article to be useful. This is why books are better for learning a new technology. You can do it with blogs, but the order in which you read blog entries may not be beneficial to you.

Once you have gained an understanding of the fundamentals via books (or other means), blogs will likely serve as the means by which you understand more advanced topics. I read blogs every day. I have learned more from them than any other source. Do not neglect this very valuable resource.

(Note, make sure I use the verb "blog" rather than "write blog entries.)

### Twitter
"Now wait a second!", I hear you saying, "Twitter is for chatting, how am I supposed to learn from a 'social network'?". To which I would respond, "If you aren't learning from the people you follow on Twitter, you are following the wrong people." 

Many of the same people who are blogging such valuable information are also on Twitter. And they are not only blogging, but also tweeting about it, and tweeting about what others have blogged or new technologies, techniques or tools they have seen. If you plug yourself into this constant discussion about the practice of software development, there is much you can learn.

Many of the tweets contain links to information that are useful. These links are usually to blog entries or other articles. Many of the blogs that I follow were blogs that I saw someone mention on twitter.

#### Who should I follow? 
Start with any blogs you have read. If the blogger is on twitter, follow them. Another way to find good people to follow is to start paying attention to the "re-tweets" you see. If a person is retweeted, it means someone thought their content was good enough to be repeated. If the content was good, follow the person who was retweeted. You can also search twitter for particular topics. See who is tweeting good content there and follow them. After a while you will have a good number of people you are following. 

It can get overwhelming if you try to read everything ever tweeted. Don't fall into this trap. Don't feel like you have to read it all, you can't and you never will. Simply join the stream and read a bit and get off. If you feel like you have to start where you last left off, you will never catch up and you will stop reading. 

Sometimes tools can help a lot to distill the massive number of tweets down to something you can digest. For instance, one tool I have used is called paper.li (link). It aggregates all the links that were tweeted by the people you are following and displays them in a newspaper-like format by category/topic. You can scan all the links each day and read only the things you are interested in. 

There are also tools that let you queue up items to read later. Some examples of these of ReadItLater, Instapaper or Spool. (links). They allow you to queue up items to read, them read them later on any of your devices (desktop, mobile, tablet, etc).

Twitter is a great way to expand your learning. It is also a great way to learn of events going on in the developer community that you may want to take advantage of.

### Attend Community Groups and Events
Every major city (and many not-so-major cities) have user groups around many different technologies. I live in Austin, and there user groups and such for almost every kind of technology imaginable. There are multiple events every week. I could never attend them all. The ones I do attend have really broadened my horizons...not only in what I have learned there, but the people I have met there. Forging relationships with others in the developer community is a great way to learn. The most common means of learning is simply asking questions. If you find people that are experienced in the area you are learning, there is no better resource than that. Having a mentor or friend that you can bounce ideas off of and ask questions from is invaluable.

Another great place to learn is at any kind of brown-bag/lunch-n-learn groups you might have at work or in your area. Some groups are book clubs that read through a book and each week get together and discuss the book. Others have developers present some interesting technology or tools they have been using. If you don't have anything like this in your company, or in the area, start one! I started weekly "Dev Shares" and a "Continuous Learning" group at my company. They take little work to keep them going, and everyone benefits.

### Blog and Present
It has been said that the best way to truly learn something is to teach it! I have found this to be absolutely true. When I prepare a presentation, I have to research the topic well and ensure not only that I understand the topic, but also that I am able to explain it clearly to others. This requires a you to understand the topic far more than if you just wanted to know it for yourself. 

A great way to deepen your knowledge and increase your ability to communicate (which we will discuss later) is to start blogging. Pick topics that you are learning and begin blogging about what you are learning. It is very rewarding and you will not only help yourself learn, but others. There are several times that someone has had a problem and I have been able to direct them to a blog entry I wrote that clearly explains the problem and how to solve it. 

Presenting on a topic takes it to the next level. Not only do you need to be able to explain the topic, but you are also opening up the possibility of others asking your questions, that you may not have rehearsed the answer for, or worse yet, you may not know the answer to. Always remember that saying "I don't know" is perfectly acceptable. Pretending you know something when you don't is not only dishonest, its a recipe for disaster.

So as you learn, reinforce your learning by teaching others what you have learned. You will benefit, and so will those you teach. 

Attend your local user group(s) and learn from those around you.

## Humility
Humility is one of the most underrated, yet essential attributes of an effective developer. It's easy to be misled into thinking that technical skills are the most important thing to look for when hiring a developer. It's a lesson I have learned on more than one occasion...I have hired people that were very knowledgable and technically skilled, but then I had to work with them. It was not a pleasant experience. 

> The effective developer is humble.

Humility is the opposite of pride. A prideful person thinks they already know everything. The humble person listens to others because he realizes that they may have an idea that is better than his own. A prideful person is argumentative and doesn't take suggestions or criticism well. The humble person considers the position of others in design discussions and rarely gets into arguments. He also views criticism as constructive and an opportunity to improve himself. A prideful person seeks to place blame when something goes wrong and refuses to admit when they have made a mistake and accept responsibility for it. The humble person seeks the solution to a problem rather than where to place blame, and easily accepts responsibility for they mistakes they have made and openly admits to them. 

Pride also stifles the ability to learn. Consider this analogy. A sick person cannot be helped by a doctor if they don't think they are sick. They will either never go to the doctor, or won't follow his advice. Likewise, the biggest barrier to learning the truth is the assumption that you already know it.

One of the primary traits of pride is self-preservation. That is the downfall of many developers--they seek to promote and preserve themselves at all costs. That is why it is so hard for them to admit fault--it is seen as a mark against them, and they don't want anyone to think negatively of them. In their minds, that's not the way to "get ahead". 

A great definition of humility is "placing the needs of others before my own."...it is "other-centeredness" as opposed to self-centeredness. The humble person places the interests of the business and the needs of others before their own. This is why a humble person can easily admit when they have made a mistake. Doing so is the quickest way to solve the problem at hand rather than wasting time playing the blame game. Not only this, but a humble person is quick to point out their own mistakes to others so they they won't make the same mistakes. Not only can you learn from your mistakes, but so can others.

In design discussions, it is vital that all members of the team are free to discuss and debate alternatives without getting into an argument. It is equally important that all team members are able to speak freely. When an argumentative person is placed in the team, they can turn these design discussions into arguments, or they can dominate the conversations and not let others speak up. Either way, it stifles productivity--team members stop contributing their ideas, either for fear of rejection, or being drug into a lengthy conversation that they cannot escape from. 

The damage this kind of personality inflicts on the team can easily go unnoticed. Unless you know what to look for, you may not realize why things are going so poorly on the team. I have been amazed (on more than one occasion) how productive our team became when one key person was removed from the team. Things just seemed to smooth out after their exit. 

Don't be the bad egg that poisons the team. Make sure you are sufficiently humble. Be a blessing to your team, not a curse.

## Communication Skills
Another important, yet often overlooked, trait of a great developer is communication skills. If you cannot clearly communicate your ideas, how can you expect them to be accepted? The importance of clear communication amongst the team in a software development project cannot be emphasized enough. Just think of the kinds of issues caused by miscommunication: Bugs are introduced due to misunderstood requirements. Arguments ensue because developers misunderstand one another. Rework must be done because standards or policies were not clearly communicated....and the list can go on and on...

Poor communication can cause problems that you don't even realize are a result of a communication failure. When I have a design disagreement with a developer that I know is intelligent and has the same project goals in mind as I do, I immediately assume there is a misunderstanding somewhere and work with the other developer to verify the assumptions we are basing our positions on. The majority of the time we find a point or two where we misunderstood one another. Once we correct those misunderstandings, an obvious solution that we both agree upon becomes apparent. Had I not sought out the misunderstanding, we would not have been able to agree and it could have damaged our relationship.

Someone has said (reference?) "Communication is something the listener does" (verify quote with Manager Tools). You can speak about some concept to another person, but if they don't understand what you said, no communication has occurred. Communication is the act of transferring a concept from your understanding to their understanding. In the end, if they understand the same thing you do, communication has occurred (should I delete this sentence minus the "In the end," part?). If they do not understand the concept, communication has not occurred. If what they understand is different from what you understand, miscommunication has occurred. Miscommunication is far more dangerous than a lack of communication because it goes undetected. The listener/reader thinks they understand correctly and may take action based on that misinformation with unknown repercussions on the project. If no communication occurred, the listener at least knows that they did not understand and won't act on false information, but may ask more questions to learn (reword this).

This book is written assuming you are a developer. If this is true, then you probably spend more time talking to a computer than to people. While we might wish that people are as easy to talk to as computers--just say what you mean and be done--they aren't. People require a lot more care and attention than computers. You often need to consider things outside the context of your communication when dealing with people. (example of how you may want to communicate differently based on external contexts).

### Types of communication. 

#### Face to Face
Highest bandwidth communication (quick feedback with body language, + ability to question) This is why colocation is a big deal in agile.
Mention reading people....expressions and body language, etc. 
Face 2 Face is two way communication even when only one person is talking

#### Voice communication (phone, etc)

#### Chat

#### Presentations

#### Spoken

#### Written (Email, SMS)

### So, how can you learn to be a better communicator?

#### In Written Text (Email)

#### In Design Discussions

#### In Presentations
