# Chapter 1: What makes a great developer?

So what makes a developer great? I have realized several attributes that are common to truly great developers.

- Passion 
- Continuous Learning
- Humility
- Communication Skills

## Passion
> _The effective developer is passionate about his work. He loves doing it, therefore he does it well._

If you really want to be good at something, you have to love doing it. You simply won't be motivated to take your skills to the next level if it doesn't excite you. But, a healthy passion for development will drive you to hone your skills, take pride in your work and do your best. This gives you a distinct advantage over other developers. 

You see, we are inclined to do what we enjoy. If we enjoy our work, we will naturally read about it, practice it and think about it, all the time--all because we enjoy it. My idea of relaxing is curling up with a good tech book, reading blogs, writing this book, etc. I love what I do and I do what I love. This is the biggest secret to my success.

When I interview developers, one of the most important things I look for is passion. 

A word of caution though...do not let your passion for work drown out other important areas of your life. Balance is important. Family, friends, church, etc. are essential for happiness. It can't come from work alone.

I will never forget what a wise friend once told me, "I work to live, I don't live to work". This should be true for all of us. Time away from the computer with our families or friends is important. Never forget that.

## Continuous Learning
A healthy passion for your work, drives you to continuously learn more and improve your skills. (elaborate)

>_The effective developer is committed to continuous learning--deliberately acquiring new skills and refining existing ones._

The software development industry evolves constantly. Technologies change quickly--what you know today will be obsolete tomorrow.  You must constantly refine your skills and learn new ones or risk being left behind. If you do not enjoy reading, listening to others, and learning from others, you will be at a huge disadvantage to those who do.

So how can you keep up with all the changes and new technologies in this fast changing industry? Here are some ideas:

### Read Books
Reading books is one of the oldest ways to learn, and it is applicable now more than ever. Books are a great way to get a full understanding of a particular area or technology. They are usually structured in such that they cover all aspects of a topic. If you are new to a technology, grabbing a good book on the subject is one of the best ways to get up to speed. Books often make an assumption that the reader has a certain level of knowledge, so the book fills all the gaps that are necessary and tries to present the material in a certain order that will make sense to the reader and build upon concepts progressively. Books are great to establish an initial foundation of knowledge that you can build upon.

#### Select Books Carefully
How do you select which books to read? Time is precious. If you are going to take the time to read a book, make sure it's a good one. Research what others have said about books in the area you are seeking to learn. Find out what books are the "must reads" in that area and pick them up and read them. It is said that the most successful people read and average of ??? books per year (Need citation). 

#### Take Notes or Highlight Your Book
To make the most of reading books, take notes, or highlight the text. Not only does this require you to think a little more (about what to write) but it also involves more motor skills which improves your retention of that information (citation). Furthermore, after reading the book, you can go back and skim your notes to refresh what you may have forgotten. 

#### Read a Book Repeatedly
Don't be afraid to read a book more than once. You will likely get much more out of the book on your second pass through. You see, you usually can't assimilate all the information from a book the first time through. The concepts it presents often depend upon one another. You can't fully understand *Concept C* until you first understand *Concept A* and *Concept B*. Because your first time through a book, you are just learning these concepts for the first time, you may fully understand *Concept A*, but only partially understand *Concept B*. Consequently, you cannot fully understand *Concept C* or any concepts that depend upon it. 

After reading the book the first time, and especially after putting the knowledge you gained into practice, you will have a better understanding of the basic concepts. Then, when you read the book a second time, you will have more experience and knowledge to relate the information to. This will allow you to understand deeper concepts expressed in the book that you may have missed the first time. 

Really good books can be read multiple times and still provide a new depth of information each time. (A great example of this is Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans. I have read this book multiple times and have learned a great deal each time I did.)

As a final note...when you do read a really good book, if you see someone who could benefit from it, please recommend it to them. Be a catalyst to help others learn.

### Read Blogs
While books are great to get a full rounded understanding of a topic, blogs are a good way to continually gain deeper, more specific knowledge of topics. Each blog entry is usually written about a specific, focused subject. Sometimes you may find a series of blog posts that serve as an introduction to some topic...but these are not as common. Following blogs over time will help you to keep up with changes to technologies and keep yourself on the bleeding edge. Unlike books, which take time to write and publish, blog entries can be written very quickly and therefore contain knowledge that may  not have had time to be published. Blogs are the bleeding edge of thought in the software world (and most others as well).

However, because blog entries are so small, focused, and released quickly, they usually assume the reader knows a great deal about the topic, so readers new to the technology may not know enough for the article to be useful. This is why books are better for learning a new technology. You can do it with blogs, but the order in which you read blog entries may not be beneficial to you.

Once you have gained an understanding of the fundamentals via books (or other means), blogs will likely serve as the means by which you understand more advanced topics. I read blogs every day. I have learned more from them than any other source. Do not neglect this very valuable resource.

(Note, make sure I use the verb "blog" rather than "write blog entries.)

### Twitter
"Now wait a second!", I hear you saying, "Twitter is for chatting, how am I supposed to learn from a 'social network'?". To which I would respond, "If you aren't learning from the people you follow on Twitter, you are following the wrong people." 

Many of the same people who are blogging such valuable information are also on Twitter. And they are not only blogging, but also tweeting about it, and tweeting about what others have blogged or new technologies, techniques or tools they have seen. If you plug yourself into this constant discussion about the practice of software development, there is much you can learn.

Many of the tweets contain links to information that are useful. These links are usually to blog entries or other articles. Many of the blogs that I follow were blogs that I saw someone mention on twitter.

#### Who should I follow? 
Start with any blogs you have read. If the blogger is on twitter, follow them. Another way to find good people to follow is to start paying attention to the "re-tweets" you see. If a person is retweeted, it means someone thought their content was good enough to be repeated. If the content was good, follow the person who was retweeted. You can also search twitter for particular topics. See who is tweeting good content there and follow them. After a while you will have a good number of people you are following. 

It can get overwhelming if you try to read everything ever tweeted. Don't fall into this trap. Don't feel like you have to read it all, you can't and you never will. Simply join the stream and read a bit and get off. If you feel like you have to start where you last left off, you will never catch up and you will stop reading. 

Sometimes tools can help a lot to distill the massive number of tweets down to something you can digest. For instance, one tool I have used is called paper.li (link). It aggregates all the links that were tweeted by the people you are following and displays them in a newspaper-like format by category/topic. You can scan all the links each day and read only the things you are interested in. 

There are also tools that let you queue up items to read later. Some examples of these of ReadItLater, Instapaper or Spool. (links). They allow you to queue up items to read, them read them later on any of your devices (desktop, mobile, tablet, etc).

Twitter is a great way to expand your learning. It is also a great way to learn of events going on in the developer community that you may want to take advantage of.

### Attend Community Groups and Events
Every major city (and many not-so-major cities) have user groups around many different technologies. I live in Austin, and there user groups and such for almost every kind of technology imaginable. There are multiple events every week. I could never attend them all. The ones I do attend have really broadened my horizons...not only in what I have learned there, but the people I have met there. Forging relationships with others in the developer community is a great way to learn. The most common means of learning is simply asking questions. If you find people that are experienced in the area you are learning, there is no better resource than that. Having a mentor or friend that you can bounce ideas off of and ask questions from is invaluable.

Another great place to learn is at any kind of brown-bag/lunch-n-learn groups you might have at work or in your area. Some groups are book clubs that read through a book and each week get together and discuss the book. Others have developers present some interesting technology or tools they have been using. If you don't have anything like this in your company, or in the area, start one! I started weekly "Dev Shares" and a "Continuous Learning" group at my company. They take little work to keep them going, and everyone benefits.

### Blog and Present
It has been said that the best way to truly learn something is to teach it! I have found this to be absolutely true. When I prepare a presentation, I have to research the topic well and ensure not only that I understand the topic, but also that I am able to explain it clearly to others. This requires a you to understand the topic far more than if you just wanted to know it for yourself. 

A great way to deepen your knowledge and increase your ability to communicate (which we will discuss later) is to start blogging. Pick topics that you are learning and begin blogging about what you are learning. It is very rewarding and you will not only help yourself learn, but others. There are several times that someone has had a problem and I have been able to direct them to a blog entry I wrote that clearly explains the problem and how to solve it. 

Presenting on a topic takes it to the next level. Not only do you need to be able to explain the topic, but you are also opening up the possibility of others asking your questions, that you may not have rehearsed the answer for, or worse yet, you may not know the answer to. Always remember that saying "I don't know" is perfectly acceptable. Pretending you know something when you don't is not only dishonest, its a recipe for disaster.

So as you learn, reinforce your learning by teaching others what you have learned. You will benefit, and so will those you teach. 

Attend your local user group(s) and learn from those around you.

## Humility
Humility is one of the most underrated, yet essential attributes of an effective developer. It's easy to be misled into thinking that technical skills are the most important thing to look for when hiring a developer. It's a lesson I have learned on more than one occasion...I have hired people that were very knowledgable and technically skilled, but then I had to work with them. It was not a pleasant experience. 

> The effective developer is humble.

Humility is the opposite of pride. A prideful person thinks they already know everything. The humble person listens to others because he realizes that they may have an idea that is better than his own. A prideful person is argumentative and doesn't take suggestions or criticism well. The humble person considers the position of others in design discussions and rarely gets into arguments. He also views criticism as constructive and an opportunity to improve himself. A prideful person seeks to place blame when something goes wrong and refuses to admit when they have made a mistake and accept responsibility for it. The humble person seeks the solution to a problem rather than where to place blame, and easily accepts responsibility for they mistakes they have made and openly admits to them. 

Pride also stifles the ability to learn. Consider this analogy. A sick person cannot be helped by a doctor if they don't think they are sick. They will either never go to the doctor, or won't follow his advice. Likewise, the biggest barrier to learning the truth is the assumption that you already know it.

One of the primary traits of pride is self-preservation. That is the downfall of many developers--they seek to promote and preserve themselves at all costs. That is why it is so hard for them to admit fault--it is seen as a mark against them, and they don't want anyone to think negatively of them. In their minds, that's not the way to "get ahead". 

A great definition of humility is "placing the needs of others before my own."...it is "other-centeredness" as opposed to self-centeredness. The humble person places the interests of the business and the needs of others before their own. This is why a humble person can easily admit when they have made a mistake. Doing so is the quickest way to solve the problem at hand rather than wasting time playing the blame game. Not only this, but a humble person is quick to point out their own mistakes to others so they they won't make the same mistakes. Not only can you learn from your mistakes, but so can others.

In design discussions, it is vital that all members of the team are free to discuss and debate alternatives without getting into an argument. It is equally important that all team members are able to speak freely. When an argumentative person is placed in the team, they can turn these design discussions into arguments, or they can dominate the conversations and not let others speak up. Either way, it stifles productivity--team members stop contributing their ideas, either for fear of rejection, or being drug into a lengthy conversation that they cannot escape from. 

The damage this kind of personality inflicts on the team can easily go unnoticed. Unless you know what to look for, you may not realize why things are going so poorly on the team. I have been amazed (on more than one occasion) how productive our team became when one key person was removed from the team. Things just seemed to smooth out after their exit. 

Don't be the bad egg that poisons the team. Make sure you are sufficiently humble. Be a blessing to your team, not a curse.

## Communication Skills
Another important, yet often overlooked, trait of a great developer is communication skills. If you cannot clearly communicate your ideas, how can you expect them to be accepted? The importance of clear communication amongst the team in a software development project cannot be emphasized enough. Just think of the kinds of issues caused by miscommunication: Bugs are introduced due to misunderstood requirements. Arguments ensue because developers misunderstand one another. Rework must be done because standards or policies were not clearly communicated....and the list can go on and on...

Poor communication can cause problems that you don't even realize are a result of a communication failure. When I have a design disagreement with a developer that I know is intelligent and has the same project goals in mind as I do, I immediately assume there is a misunderstanding somewhere and work with the other developer to verify the assumptions we are basing our positions on. The majority of the time we find a point or two where we misunderstood one another. Once we correct those misunderstandings, an obvious solution that we both agree upon becomes apparent. Had I not sought out the misunderstanding, we would not have been able to agree and it could have damaged our relationship.

Someone has said (reference?) "Communication is something the listener does" (verify quote with Manager Tools). You can speak about some concept to another person, but if they don't understand what you said, no communication has occurred. Communication is the act of transferring a concept from your understanding to their understanding. In the end, if they understand the same thing you do, communication has occurred (should I delete this sentence minus the "In the end," part?). If they do not understand the concept, communication has not occurred. If what they understand is different from what you understand, miscommunication has occurred. Miscommunication is far more dangerous than a lack of communication because it goes undetected. The listener/reader thinks they understand correctly and may take action based on that misinformation with unknown repercussions on the project. If no communication occurred, the listener at least knows that they did not understand and won't act on false information, but may ask more questions to learn (reword this).

This book is written assuming you are a developer. If this is true, then you probably spend more time talking to a computer than to people. While we might wish that people are as easy to talk to as computers--just say what you mean and be done--they aren't. People require a lot more care and attention than computers. You often need to consider things outside the context of your communication when dealing with people. (example of how you may want to communicate differently based on external contexts).

### Types of communication. 

#### Face to Face
Highest bandwidth communication (quick feedback with body language, + ability to question) This is why colocation is a big deal in agile.
Mention reading people....expressions and body language, etc. 
Face 2 Face is two way communication even when only one person is talking

#### Voice communication (phone, etc)

#### Chat

#### Presentations

#### Spoken

#### Written (Email, SMS)

### So, how can you learn to be a better communicator?

#### In Written Text (Email)

#### In Design Discussions

#### In Presentations
