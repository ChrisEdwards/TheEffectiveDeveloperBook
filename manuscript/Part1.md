-# Part 1: Soft Skills
 
In part 1 I am going to discuss what I feel is the most important aspect of an effective developer: _Soft skills_. Soft skills are the behaviors, habits and personality traits that characterize your relationships with other people--sometimes referred to as _people skills_ or _social skills_. Soft skills complement your hard skills, which are your technical proficiencies and the capability to do your job. 

To be truly effective, you have to have both types of skills.
Hard skills are easy to attain.
Soft skills are hard to attain.
Better to hire someone with soft skills. Can train hard skills.
Soft skills are severely undervalued. 
Soft skills enhance effectiveness. More than hard skills. 
Soft skills result in teachability. 
Soft skills benefit others. Hard skills benefit self, and only benefit others if taught (using soft skills).

Because most developers focus solely on hard skills, it is easy to find technically proficient people. Yet finding those equally proficient in soft skills is difficult.

But they will enhance your effectiveness more than any technology you can learn.

I believe so strongly that soft skills are important that I have placed them at the beginning of this book. _First thing first!_
