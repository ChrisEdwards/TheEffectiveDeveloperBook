This book is the result of a series of events that began when I attended a presentation at the Austin Code Camp several years ago here in Austin, TX. It was in introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD) given by Mahendra Mavani. Honestly, I wouldn't have attended the session if I knew it was an introduction. I had used TDD for years, so an introductory course wasn't going to be that helpful to me. But I am sure glad I was there. 

The questions everyone asked shocked me. They wanted to know the basics--things I assumed everyone already knew. I took it for granted that everyone knew TDD, but these developers had never tried it; some had never even written unit tests before. In this flood of sessions on advanced topics and new technologies, this room-full of developers desperately thirst for the basics. The irony hit me like a ton of bricks. What good were all our advanced sessions to them? Sure, I love to give talks on new stuff just as much as the next guy, but this talk opened my eyes to a greater need. 

Over the next couple of years I started giving a presentation called *"Padawan to Jedi - A Developer's Jump Start"* (Yes, I admit it…I am a Star Wars fanboy). I designed the talk to cover a broad spectrum of all the things that I felt a modern developer needed to know to be effective. It didn't take long for me to realize that's a lot to cover! I only had two hours to talk, so I couldn't go into much detail. To make up for it, I decided to provide links where the listeners could learn more about each topic. That way they could get the detail if they wanted it, and I could cover more in my talk.

The first time I gave the talk I finished in just under two hours. I must have had a ton of caffeine because when I listened to the recording afterward, I was talking really fast. I barely finished.

A year later I gave the talk again. However, I had learned a lot in that year--things I felt were valuable--so I added them to the talk. To my dismay, I only got half-way through the talk before I ran out of time. I talked for two solid hours and wasn't even half done! But the audience was engaged and asking questions the entire time. When it was over, many of them said they really wanted more… 

So here it is! This book is a distillation of things I have learned in the last twenty years of working as a professional software developer. I have tried to include everything I feel a developer needs to be effective. It is by no means complete, and definitely not perfect. But this is the book I wish someone had handed me the day I started developing software. And so now I hand it to you.

There is something here for everyone--whether you are an architect, senior developer, team lead, or newcomer to programming. But it's primarily written for those who want to learn the basics of modern development practices and get a taste of how effective developers work. Some of the topics are very basic. Some are just plain common sense. If you already understand something, feel free to skip it. You don't have to read this book in order. Read only the parts you need, when you need them, or read it straight through. Whatever works best for you.

It is my desire and prayer that this book helps you become a more effective developer. If you don't even know where to start, don't fear, you have taken a good first step.

God bless you,
